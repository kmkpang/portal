                    <OfficeDescription>Cha Am is a little known gem and the ideal location to get away from it all, in a
                        beautiful and unspoilt part of Thailand.

                        Cha Am has everything the mature or discerning holiday maker needs. From the mountain backdrop
                        and coconut palms to the golden sandy beach lined with redwood evergreens, from the easily
                        affordable restaurants to the friendly charming bars, Cha Am has a special relaxing feel and
                        innocence that no other town in this magical Kingdom possesses.


                        Cha Am is situated in Phetchaburi province, 108 miles (175km) south of Bangkok (see map) with a
                        population of about 25,000. It only takes 2 hours from Bangkok International Airport before you
                        find yourself in this little paradise. Cha Am has very accessible transport links with its own
                        train station and regular air-conditioned busses en-route from Bangkok to the South.

                        In Cha Am, you will enjoy summer and sun 12 months a year, an exciting rich culture and the
                        possibility to obtain a comfortable living standard at a very reasonable price.
